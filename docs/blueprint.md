## Core Features:

- Canvas display: Display an HTML canvas element on the screen.
- Draw mode: The user will be able to choose a drawing tool. Each tool must produce strokes which are anti-aliased.
- Color Selection: Choose the color to paint in the canvas
- Stroke Weight Selection: Choose the size/weight of the stroke.
- Infinite canvas: The user will be able to pan and zoom to navigate a region much larger than the original HTML canvas.
- Inpainting tool: Using a generative AI tool, automatically repair and extend strokes on the canvas based on their surrounding context.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grayish-blue (#98B4C5) to suggest technology in a subtle, sophisticated way.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F4F7). This should harmonize with the primary color above, creating a light and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Darker blue (#5B869E), also analogous, to make key functions such as tools and the drawing canvas stand out.
- Font choice: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern interface. To be used for all text on the site, for maximum clarity of controls and other text.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent drawing tools and options.
- Clean, intuitive layout with a focus on the canvas area. The toolbar is docked on the left or right and designed to minimize obstruction of the canvas.
- Subtle animations on tool selection and when using generative AI to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
